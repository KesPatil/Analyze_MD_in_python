# Analyze_MD_in_python

Description on RMSD_file_creator.py :
This is a python code that will help you to extract structures from the MD trajectory files that belong to certain locations on the free energy profile that was generated using Metadynamics or some other sampling technique.
File could be modified for various uses: with focus being on extracting structures that belong to a certain location on the Free energy profile.

Description of free_ener_contour.py : 
This is a python code to plot the 2 dimensional free energy profile that has been generated through Metadynamics Run using PLUMED. The fes.dat file that PLUMED generates has information on number of bins along each collective variable. The code has to be yet modified for argument passing where the n_bins along each collective variable should be made the arguments.
